# Libft Project 🚀  

Welcome to my implementation of the **Libft Project**, part of the 1337 curriculum! This repository contains a custom library of C functions that replicates and extends the functionality of the standard C library.  

## 🌟 Features  
- Reimplementations of standard library functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and more.  
- Additional utilities for memory management and string manipulation.  
- Robust testing to ensure reliability and correctness.  

## 🛠️ How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
